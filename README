Rubik's cube in terminal
========================
                     by Anatoli Sakhnik.

This is an implementation of Rubik's cube puzzle
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik_cube) for linux terminal.

The idea is to print all the faces on a flat cube fold:
     T          top
    LFRB        left,front,right,back
     D          down

Turns are performed by entering face name, and optional slice number
in a very similar manner to to what solving algorithm descriptions use.
Small letters designate clockwise rotation, capitals are used
for the opposite direction.


FUTURE
------

This was a week-end project, so it's unclear. Possible ways for improvement:
  * mouse support
  * automatic solver
